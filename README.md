### TinyPngPlugin
`TinyPngPlugin` is a Gradle plugin for [TinyPng](https://tinypng.com/), can batch optimize your images.

### Get Tiny API key
Before use this plugin, you need get a Tiny API Key first. Goto [Tiny Developers Page](https://tinypng.com/developers), input your email and name to get the key.

*Notice: The first 500 compressions each month are free. You will only be billed if you compress more than 500 images.*

### Getting Started
Add `TinyPngPlugin` as a dependency in your main build.gradle in the root of your project:

 	dependencies {
    	classpath 'com.waynell.tinypng:TinyPngPlugin:1.0.5'
	}

Then you need to apply the plugin and configure your `tinyinfo` by adding the following lines to your `app/build.gradle`:

 	apply plugin: 'com.waynell.tinypng'

 	tinyInfo {
    	resourceDir = [
			// your res dir
            "app/src/main/res",
            "lib/src/main/res"
    	]
        resourcePattern = [
        	// your res pattern
        	"drawable[a-z-]*",
            "mipmap[a-z-]*"
        ]
        whiteList = [
        	// your white list, support Regular Expressions
        ]
        apiKey = [
			/**
			 * enter your tiny API key list
			 * Support multiple configurations, each key is only 500/month, 
			 * a key failure immediately switch the second key to do compression
			 */
        ]
    }

If you are using `Android Studio`, you can find the generate task option in `tinypng` group. Or alternatively, you run `./gradlew tinyPng` in your terminal.

`TinyPngPlugin` has a `compressed-resource.json` file to record the compressed result, next time `TinyPngPlugin` will skip these files that have been compressed.
